● React is a JavaScript library. (This is not a Framework.)
● React's main focus is to build UIs as quickly as possible.
● React is designed to create a single-page application (SPA).
	-->means a full website on a single page.
● React is fast because it uses Virtual DOM.
	==> If a website is built properly with React,
	    it will only load once, and if any changes 
	    are made to the source code, an algorithm 
	    will only check for new changes and render 
	    the specifically changed part rather than 
	    rendering the whole page or DOM.

● Famous Applications built with React:--
	1) Netflix
	2) Whatsapp web
	3) Instagram
